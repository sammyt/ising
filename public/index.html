    <p>The other day I was looking back over some old emails, and I found
    a thread between myself and one of my old university tutors.  I followed
    the thread to find my submission of a Java simulation of the Ising Model.
    I took a peek for old times sake.</p> 

    <p>Looking over old code can be a humbling experience.</p>

    <p>Once I had recovered from the initial shock I started to dig into the
    physics of the simulation.  It's a simple enough simulation of the Ising
    Model in two dimensions.  I say simple, because the model is conceptually
    simple to understand given a few diagrams and a couple of paragraphs.
    I know this because I quickly gave up trying to figure out how my
    simulation mapped back to a physical system and took to the internets for
    answers.</p>

    <p>Amongst the excellent explanations there were a number of other
    simulations (mostly in Java) whose code I could read.  They all appeared to
    be very similar (including my original solution), solving the model
    with very imperative code.  Often making optimizations that make some
    pretty large readability sacrifices.</p>

    <p>I've been working heavily in ClojureScript recently, its functional
    roots and elegant data structures have had an big impact on how I think
    about and solve problems.  So I thought I'd have a go at rebuilding the
    simulation in idiomatic (to the best of my current knowledge) ClojureScript
    to run within the browser.</p>

    <h2>Ising</h2>

    <p>The Ising model describes a idealised magnetic material, by modeling
    a series of interacting charged particles.  It's named after a clever chap
    called Ernest Ising who solved the problem (in 1 dimension) mathematically
    for his PHd.  This article is going to be pretty light on mathematics
    (phew), instead I'll be doing a Monte Carlo simulation of the Ising model in
    2 dimensions using the Metropolis algorithm.</p>

    <p>So before diving into the algorithm here is a super basic explanation of
    the Ising model in 2 dimensions.  I recommend if you are interested you
    take a look at some of the other explanations out there, as I'm going to
    gloss over lots of the details, just explaining what I hope is enough to
    understand the code and the principles of the physical interactions.</p> 

    <p>Picture a 2D lattice of charged particles, called spins.  Each of the
    spins can either point up or down.  In this particular lattice our spins
    are in their lowest energy state when spins are aligned in the same
    direction (giving us a ferromagnet).  Physical systems love there
    lowest energy states, so we expect that if we don't add any extra energy
    (heat) then the spins will all attempt to align, and thus magnetise.</p>

    <p>Here is a lattice with some energy stored up.  We can see that it is
    not in its lowest energy state by looking at the centre most spin, which
    is pointing down when all the spins closest to it are pointing up.</p>

        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&darr;</td>

      <tr>

        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&darr;</td>

        <td>&uarr;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>At a low enough temperature we would expect that the lattice would, over
    time, lower its energy and the spins would align</p>


    <h2>Metropolis</h2>

    <p>The Metropolis algorithm gives us some simple steps we can take to
    update our lattice, taking it from one state to another.  The states that
    the metropolis algorithm takes us through should progress the system in
    a way the is consistent with its physical rules, but not so computationally
    exhaustive that we would never get anywhere. </p>

    <p>To take the lattice from one state to another we will attempt to flip
    a single spin, reversing its direction.  The algorithm give us the
    following method to determine if the flip is acceptable.</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Choose any spin from within the lattice at random</li>
      <li>Calculate the energy require to flip just that spin</li>
      <li>If the energy require to flip it is negative, then make the
      flip, and stop. If however the flip would require energy to complete
      then only flip it based on a calculated probability.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>That sounds fairly straight forward.  There are two things we need to
    be able to calculate in order to make it work.  Firstly we need to know
    how to find the change in energy that would occur if a spin is flipped.
    Then we need to be able to calculate this probability, used to determine
    if the spin should be flipped when the energy increases.</p>
