    <p>The other day I was looking back over some old emails, and I found
    a thread between myself and one of my old university tutors.  I followed
    the thread to find my submission of a Java simulation of the Ising Model.
    I took a peek.</p> 

    <p>Looking over old code can be a humbling experience.</p>

    <p>Once I had recovered from the initial shock I started to dig into the
    physics of the simulation.  It's a simple enough simulation of the Ising
    Model in two dimensions.  I say simple, because the model is conceptually
    simple to understand given a few diagrams and a couple of paragraphs.
    I know this because I quickly gave up trying to figure out how my
    simulation mapped back to a physical system and took to the internet for
    answers.</p>

    <p>Amongst the excellent explanations there were a number of other
    simulations (mostly in Java) whose code I read.  They all appeared to
    be very similar (including my original solution), solving the model with
    very imperative code.  Often making optimizations with pretty large
    readability sacrifices.  Like my original I found it very difficult to
    see the underly physics, or indeed the simulation algorithm being used
    through the implementation details.</p>

    <p>I wondered what the same simulation would look like in Clojure(Script)
    with its functional roots and elegant data structures.  So I has a go at
    rebuilding it in idiomatic (to the best of my current knowledge)
    ClojureScript to run within the browser.</p>

    <h2>What is the Ising Model?</h2>

    <p>I'm going to gloss over lots of the details, just explaining what I hope
    is enough to understand the code and the principles of the physical
    interactions.</p> 
    
    <p>The Ising model describes an idealised magnetic material, by modeling
    a series of interacting charged particles.</p>
    
    <p>So picture a lattice of charged particles, called spins.  Each of the
    spins can either point up or down.  In this particular lattice our spins
    are in their lowest energy state when spins are aligned in the same
    direction (meaning we have a ferromagnet).  Physical systems love there
    lowest energy states, so we expect that if we don't add any extra energy
    (heat) then the spins will all attempt to align, and thus magnetise.</p>

    <p>Here is a lattice with some energy stored up.  We can see that it is
    not in its lowest energy state by looking at the centre most spin, which
    is pointing down when all the spins closest to it are pointing up.</p>

    <table>
     <tr>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&darr;</td>
        <td>&darr;</td>
        <td>&darr;</td>
        <td>&darr;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&darr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>

        <td>&uarr;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&darr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
        <td>&uarr;</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>At a low enough temperature we would expect that the lattice would, over
    time, align its spins increasing the overall magnetisation.  If we were to
    add lots of energy the spins would be more likely to oppose their
    neighbours, and the magnetisation would decrease.</p>

    <h2>Simulating with Metropolis</h2>

    <p>The Metropolis algorithm gives us some simple steps we can take to
    update our lattice, moving it from one state to another. Applying the
    Metropolis Algorithm should progress the lattice in a way the is consistent
    with its physical rules, but not so computationally exhaustive that we
    would never get anywhere.</p>

    <p>To take the lattice from one state to another we will attempt to flip
    a single spin, reversing its direction.  The algorithm gives us the
    following method to determine if the flip is acceptable.</p>

     <ol>
      <li>Choose any spin from within the lattice at random</li>

      <li>Calculate the energy required to flip just that spin</li>

      <li>If the energy required to flip it is negative, then make the flip. If
      however the flip would require energy to complete then only flip it based
      on a probability distribution.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>The Ising model defines the equations needed for calculating the energy
    change and the probability distribution.</p>
    
    <p>And that's about it.  The simulation runs these Metropolis steps over
    and over at different temperatures to investigate the effect on the
    magnetisation.</p>

    
   <h2>Metropolis in Clojure</h2>

   <p>Lets jump into the code and look at how I've tried to represent the above
   steps in Clojure.</p>

   <pre><code class="clojure">
(defn metropolis-step 
  "progress a lattice on by one metropolis step.
  
    rand-pos:   generates a random valid position
    neighbours: finds positions of neighbours 
    temp:       the current lattice temperature
    lattice:    a Set of the positive spins"

  [rand-pos neighbours temp lattice]

  (let [pos (rand-pos)
        spin (if (contains? lattice pos) 1 -1)
        delta (* spin (energy lattice (neighbours pos)))]

    ;; is the flip acceptable
    (if (or (neg? delta)
            (&lt (rand) (weighting delta temp)))
      ;; make the flip
      (if (contains? lattice pos)
        (disj lattice pos)
        (conj lattice pos))
      ;; flip rejected
      lattice)))
   </code></pre>

   <p>Step one of the Metropolis algorithm is to generate a random position
   within a lattice, I've done this by providing a function which knows
   how to generate a position for the given lattice.</p>

   <p>I then go on to compute the <code>delta</code> in energy required to flip
   the randomly selected spin.  I've used another function <code>energy</code>
   in the process which calculates the magnitude of the energy change should
   a spin be flipped.</p>

   <p>The body of the function is then left to decide based on those values if
   a spin should be flipped.  <code>weighting</code> calculates the probability
   distribution based on the change in energy and the temperature.</p>

   <h2>An imperative Metropolis</h2>

   <p>To understand how this is different, lets contrast the above solution 
   to an imperative solution in JavaScript (could have used Java, but trying
   to save some ink).</p>

   <pre><code>
metropolisStep(){
  int x = rand()
    , y = rand()

  int spin = lattice[x][y]

  int west  = cyclic(x - 1, width)
    , east  = cyclic(x + 1, width)
    , north = cyclic(y + 1, height)
    , south = cyclic(y - 1, height)

  float delta = energy(spin, north, south, east, west)

  if(delta &lt 0 || Math.rand() &lt prob(delta, temp)){
    lattice[x][y] *= -1
  }
}
   </code></pre>

   <h3>What is a lattice?</h3>

    <p>Perhaps the most important decision in the code base will be how to
    model the lattice with Clojures data structures.  All the code from that
    point on will be a means of updating, querying or rendering the lattice,
    so its impact will be evident throughout the code.</p>

   <p>Clojures data structures are at the heart of the language, affecting much
   more than how you model your data.  Clojure encourages you to program to
   abstractions, not the abstractions you invent, but the genuinely generic
   abstractions which the language is built on.  And no abstractions in Clojure
   are more important than those of its data structures.</p>

   <p>When I last attempted this problem in Java I created an array of arrays,
   to represent the 2 dimensions, then populated each item with a 1 or -1 to
   represent each spin.</p>

   <p>This time I am going to use a Set</p>

   <pre><code class="clojure">
#{[1 3] [3 5] [2 2]}
   </code></pre>

   <p>Why a Set?  If we forget all this talk of 2D for a moment, a lattice is
   a collection of spins, and each spin has a unique position.  So if the
   positions are unique then they could be used as values in a Set.  We also
   know that spins can only be positive or negative (1 or -1), which means that
   any spin that isn't positive must be negative.  So the whole state of the
   lattice can be stored in a simple Set, where only the positions of either
   the positive or negative spins are held</p>

   <p>By choosing to use one of the native collection types I will be in much
   better placed to leverage the full power of Clojures fabulous collection
   abstractions.</p>


   <p>In this implementation a lattice will be represented by just its positive
   spins</p>

   <h3>Progress, as a sequence</h3>

   <p>Now I have Set for a lattice I want to update it using the Metropolis
   Alg.  Each time a spin is flipped (or not) the state of the system
   progresses.  Again the more I leverage the language the more I know it will
   reward me, so I am going to try and represent this progression of time as
   a Clojure abstraction, the sequence.</p>
  
   <p>To create a sequence from a function I'm using <code>iterate</code>.
   Iterate returns a lazy sequence of a function applied over and over to
   a seed</p>

   <pre><code class="clojure">
   (inc 0)
   ;= 1
   (first (iterate inc 0))
   ;= 0
   (take 5 (iterate inc 0))
   ;= (0 1 2 3 4)
   </code></pre>

   <p>I just need to write my Metropolis step function to take a lattice as
   input and produce the next lattice state as output to partake in the above
   example</p>
